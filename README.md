# 1989.vim

A color scheme for people who like vim and Taylor Swift.

## Basic use:
- copy the `1989.vim` file into your colors directory (generally `~/.vim/colors`, prob different on Windows)
- add `colorscheme 1989` to your `~/.vimrc` or test it out inside vim using `:colorscheme 1989`


It should work equally well with 256-color terminals and GUI vim.

I've tested it mostly with Ruby so far, will hopefully work on improving it for other languages soon!
